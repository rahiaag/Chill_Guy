/*
ðŸ“Œ Selection Sort Algorithm:
- Finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion.
- After each pass, the smallest element is placed in its correct position.

ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis:
  - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (even in the Best Case, due to nested loops)
  - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting, no extra space required)
  - Not Stable (swapping may change the relative order of equal elements)

âœ… Applications:
  - Useful when minimizing the number of swaps is important.
  - Works well for small datasets.
  - Simple and easy to implement.

ðŸ“Œ Real-Life Analogy:
  - Imagine lining up people by height:
    - Find the shortest person and place them first.
    - Then, find the next shortest and place them second.
    - Repeat until everyone is in order.
