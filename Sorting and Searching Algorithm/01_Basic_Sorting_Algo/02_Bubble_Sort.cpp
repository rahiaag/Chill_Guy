/*
ðŸ“Œ Bubble Sort Algorithm:
- Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- After each pass, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.
- Optimized with a `swapped` flag to stop early if the array is already sorted.

ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis:
  - Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
  - Worst Case: O(nÂ²) (when the array is in reverse order)
  - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
  - Stability: Bubble Sort is stable (preserves the relative order of equal elements).

âœ… Applications:
  - Useful for small datasets.
  - Simple and easy to implement.
  - Good for learning sorting concepts.

ðŸ“Œ Real-Life Analogy:
  - Imagine sorting a line of people by height:
    - Compare two people at a time.
    - If the taller one is ahead of the shorter one, swap them.
    - Repeat until everyone is in the correct order.
